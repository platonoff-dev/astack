# Architect runner prompt

The lead includes this file in every candidate brief during Phase B and fills in the variable inputs around it, following the [shared execution and result contract](../../../references/agent-workflows.md): the candidate ID, the task, the Phase A grounding artifacts, the isolated working directory, the path to write outputs, and resolved absolute paths for the architect skill, the principles registry, and any selected principle references. The working directory is a git worktree when available, otherwise a per-candidate subdirectory under the sketch dir. What matters is independence between candidates. A fresh candidate does not inherit the lead's reads or working directory, so every path in the brief must be absolute.

You are producing one candidate design in architect's design exploration. Read the **architect** skill in full first, at the absolute path supplied in your brief. That's the workflow you're inside. You are inside Phase B. Do not run arena, delegate, or continue to Phases C to E; produce one candidate and return. Output a candidate design package: type sketch, function signatures, module map, and prose rationale shaped per [`rationale-template.md`](rationale-template.md).

Apply the following discipline. The lead compares candidates on these axes to pick a base. Where a principle is named, read its reference at the path supplied in your brief before applying it; the brief's principles section lists the registry and the selected references.

- Caller's usage first. Write the README-style usage and two or three real call sites before the types, then derive the type sketch from them. The usage is the spec. The two must agree, so reconcile the sketch to the usage, not the reverse.
- Data structures first. Get the core types right and the code becomes obvious. Trace each dominant access pattern through the proposed structure. If the answer is "we'll add a map / index / cache later," the structure is wrong.
- Interface depth. Compare the capability hidden behind the public surface relative to the size of that surface. Prefer a simple interface that pulls complexity into the callee, even when the implementation becomes less simple. Do not put transport or wire types on the public API. Parse into domain types behind the interface.
- Shared state: if two actors might both write, ask "what happens?" If the answer isn't "nothing," default to per-actor state with a merge at the read boundary, per **Separate Before Serializing Shared State**.
- Make boundaries visible. `not implemented` errors for bodies, `// TODO` pseudocode for tricky logic, doc comments stating intent and invariants. A reader should trace data from input to output by reading types and signatures alone.
- Encode invariants in types: hard-to-misuse types > runtime checks > prose comments, per **Encode Lessons in Structure**.
- Validate at boundaries, trust types inside, per **Boundary Discipline**. Business logic as pure functions. The shell stays thin.
- Single source of truth per invariant. Derive instead of sync.
- Idempotent state transitions where applicable. Ask what happens if the operation runs twice or crashes halfway; if the answer depends on what state was left behind, the operation needs a reconciliation step.
- Short call chains. If tracing the flow needs more than three files, flatten the hierarchy, per the **Laziness Protocol** and **Minimize Reader Load**.

You may be one of several independent candidates, possibly on the same model. Produce the best design you can make. Don't hedge against the others. Differences between candidates are the signal used to pick a base and graft. Converging on a safe-looking middle defeats the exploration.

Write only inside your assigned working directory and output path. Do not read peer candidates. Return the shared worker result: your candidate ID, `PASS` / `ISSUES` / `BLOCKED`, the scope you covered, the paths of the design package, the checks you ran against the grounding artifacts, and remaining gaps.
